# Flower_Classification_Model

## This is my first project related to data science and machine learning 

In this project, I use the KNN algorithm to classify three types of flowers 
we get the dataset form .csv file that contains flower petal width, petal length 
sepal width, sepal length and type of flower.

### Steps to follow .
#### Step 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data
#### Step 2 - Data Cleaning and Handling
#### Step 3 - Data Visualisation
#### Step 4 - Model Building, Prediction and Performance Measurement
