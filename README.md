we get the dataset form .csv file that contain flower petal width ,petal length 
sepal width ,sepal length and type of flower.

### Steps to follow .
#### Step 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data
#### Step 2 - Data Cleaning and Handling
#### Step 3 - Data Visualisation
#### Step 4 - Model Building, Prediction and Performance Measurement
